      Hi, I’m Troy and this is my website.
      {'\n'}{'\n'}
    I am a data engineer who enjoys composing as well. I am currently based in New York City, working at Pulse Analytics. This website serves to collect my public computer science work, compositions, and other miscellaneous items I may be working on. If you’d like to contact me, you can email me at trschwab7 @ gmail.com.

    Hope you have a lovely day
      </p>
