      I've enjoyed trying to read folk tales from different cultures, and the idea that there are grand books of them has been a fun thing to think about when considering prospective reads. I think that’s a pretty firm description of the Decameron, or Canterbury Tales, or Arabian Nights. I wonder how integral folk tales are to a culture’s collective sense of lit. And what are contemporary/classic novels if not retellings or extensions of those essential tales? Marquez said that about 1yos, critics said that about Palm Wine Drinkard, I certainly felt that way reading some of Calvino’s IC or Tolstoys short stories. I’m really falling down a rabbit hole here but I think I’m on to something (it’ll probably boil down to a banal observation / common knowledge).

Another side note is that this was my first NYRB read which is exciting.

Anyways…this is a great collection of Japanese folk tales. I read pretty on and off over the past 6 months or so, I can’t get too detailed on the earlier half but I certainly remember those stories more fondly. I was surprised to find out that I’ve actually read this translator before; John Bester translated Sun & Steel — and it certainly won’t be the last time I read his translations either, I think I see he has an Oe translation. Kenji Miyazawa is one of those great multifaceted figures. He was a writer of poetry, a teacher, a cellist, and a painter. The painting thing is peculiar because I can’t really find any documentation of it aside from one or two paintings that come up via google. Can that eclectic nature be seen in his writing? A firm yes to that question.

 — not only was I unaware I had read John Bester, but I was unaware I had watched adaptions of Miyazawa’s stories! Gauche the Cellist from Isao Takahata (co founder of Ghibli) and Night on the Galactic Railroad from Gisaburo Sugii.

This review doesn’t feel very cohesive so I’ll explicitly say: I think that OAF is a well rounding and good read.
