      The idea of focusing on a breadth and diversity in reading via the author's birthplace has been an idea that 
      I've had at the core of my book selection since I got back into reading just 3 years ago. An even stronger 
      assertion of that idea is if the book is some form of folk tales, which incidentally are triumphed as great 
      representatives of the culture and aren't infrequently stamped with the label “classic” or get roped into a 
      list of canonic works. Decameron or Canterbury Tales or Arabian Nights, I've even heard Marquez's One Hundred 
      Years of Solitude or Tutuola's Palm Wine Drinkard described as loose conglomerations of folk stories and old 
      wive's tales. It's hard to avoid the folk tale rabbit hole - Calvino, Tolstoy, Goethe, the list is seemingly 
      endless. I had initially thought that Kenji Miyazawa's stories, beloved in Japan, were going to be adaptions 
      of classic folktales but as I began to read more about him I found that while Japanese mythology and folklore 
      was integrated heavily in his lit they were actually all original stories.

      Now I'm sure that if I read a larger collection of those Japanese folktales I'd find unmistakable parallels 
      with Once and Forever but as it stands now these are written up tonally as original works, and how striking 
      they are. Regardless of if they're “children's stories”, they occupy an airy space and certainly hold mature 
      themes. I would say that the best part of these stories is their simplicity, and while that feature, in my 
      opinion, really highlights the brilliant storytelling here - I actually think the best part of the stories is 
      their integration of mythos or magical ideas. It's not even precisely in all the stories, but at points the 
      mundane becomes magical in the hands of Miyazawa. One of the last stories, Kenju's Wood, presents a simple 
      story of a “slow” man planting trees in a peculiar way and his passing, but the trees continuing on as part 
      of a nearby school yard. The trees serve some magical purpose in a way, especially with this story nestled in 
      between talking crabs and marching telephone poles.

      Kenju's Wood actually is a bit of a special read. Kenju leaves behind something special for the local school 
      children before his untimely death to Typhus. In a similar way, Kenji Miyazawa leaves behind his legacy and 
      beautiful children's stories behind, dying at the young age of 37 to tuberculosis. His health was weakened by a 
      strict diet he observed in solidarity with the local peasantry.

      This was my first NYRB read, the publisher for my specific edition. In fact I think that I found this book 
      through that publisher, who focus on republishing fiction or non-fiction books that they find important which 
      otherwise could be difficult to find, maybe even out of print. The translation was from John Bester. I was 
      surprised to find out that I've actually read this translator before; John Bester translated Sun & Steel — and 
      it certainly won't be the last time I read his translations either, I think I see he has an Oe translation. Both 
      Bester and NYRB will be good to keep in mind.

      Miyazawa stretches into the role of a classic multifaceted man. He was a writer of poetry, a teacher, 
      a cellist, and a painter. He studied agriculture and worked to better the lives of those impoverished farmers 
      around him in Iwate. Some of his stories even are adapted to the big screen which I had unknowingly seen over the 
      years, both Night on the Galactic Railroad and Gauche the Cellist.

      OAF all over is a well rounding and good read. I think that my favorite stories were
      General Son Ba-yu, The First Deer Dance, The Bears of Nametoko, The Wildcat and The Acorns, Gorsch the Cellist, 
      and Kenju's Wood. This was a read I have been picking up and down for a long time because of the separation 
      of the stories. I'm really pleased to have finished it and am looking forward to reading some more Miyazawa.

      There is a memorial museum erected in his honor in Iwate.

      Looking at images of Hanamaki, I can better understand the beautiful images Miyazawa draws from.
