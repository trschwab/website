      Chess has been a core hobby of mine since around 2020 when I began to play during covid. It has been a long run of inconsistent play between the two main websites for online chess lichess.org and chess.com . Between the two I’ve played probably around 3500 games, which if we assume averages at about 10 minutes total, will come out to 583 hours or 24 days of play time. Fortunately for me, I still feel as though I’m improving after such a large amount of time in game, with my peak being early September 2023. That rating was on Chess.com at 1794, in the top .5% of players internationally, nearly in the top 100,000 players. I’m currently floating around mid to low 1600s, or around the top 1% of players. The difference between 1600 and 1800, while only .5%, is monumental. What happened in September that pushed my rating to its limits?

I started playing boring chess.

Boring chess — what does that even mean? The layman says all chess is boring, to which the beginning and intermediate players insist on riveting positions. Cutthroat fights for checkmate, large swings in momentum between players. Queenside castling with a pawn storm to the opponents kingside castle. Unsound gambits like The Meitner Mieses or Evans. Greek Gift Sacrifice comes up a lot in this early player “exciting” chess, as do positions that overload the queen, putting her on the frontline to pressure the board.

And what can the layman do other than nod? Those positions are riveting — dripping with aggression. The mere forward queen placement is highly intimidating, and (to the untrained eye) front loaded attacking positions appear to benefit the offensive player. I’ve even heard of cases in classical high level professional games when queen placement is used to offset the opponent, with no tangible threats — simply intimidation.

These aggressive positions come with a downside though; they neglect straightforward principles of chess that create strong healthy board positions. Instead, tempo is spent on the attack — pieces find themselves out of position trying to construct threats that have basic defenses. The aggression cannot be maintained, and if the defending player can outlast attacks, the resulting positions end up favoring their healthy position. Chess is not a game that can be won within the first few moves. Principles must be observed. Claiming some of the center with pawns, developing minor pieces, and castling — not all advanced play demands these steps, but only experts in chess can understand positions when there is value in neglect.

As I increased my rating slowly but surely, I stopped trying to force exciting initial positions by unsound play. Around when I was in the 1400s I would play a Giuoco Piano variation I enjoyed that attempted to delay castling until I could castle queenside, hopefully with an open file to attack down on the kingside. In the position, shown below, you can see that Ne2 attempts to bait out a Bxf3 to open the G file. A quick pawn to c3 would fully restrain the C6 Knight. The rooks down the open file show too much strength, and the queen attempting to defend is useless as they bulldoze down the open files. There are a lot of lines in this opening, and I figured the castling neglect was worth the attacking ability.



Looking through some of the below games is painful, the board is a complete mess in all cases.

Did I invent a new Giuoco Piano line? No, the reason why this line doesn’t exist in the first place is explicitly because it is a dubious, unsound, and impractical line. It’s an average player fumbling around on the chess board. In Giuoco Piano positions now I play calm and secure moves. I develop appropriately, and play chess with the long term goal in mind. A quick gimmicky checkmate can be avoided, but a rock solid position will, overtime, overpower the opponent.

Let’s be clear though, playing boring chess was not the only thing I did to increase my rating so significantly. It’s not like I was a Meitner Mieses player before that quit the opening cold turkey. I would occasionally avoid a castle for tempo, but I didn’t refuse it, or insist on opposite side castling. Another major part of my improvement over the past year has been playing subtle and quiet moves. Moves that do not heavily impact the position that only improve my board state structurally.

My improvement can also be tied to knowing how to play and when. It’s not uncommon to go down a piece and find yourself in a losing position as is the opposite case, when you’re up a piece winning. These pieces may not even be minor pieces like bishops or knights but can even extend to structural sound-ness, or even a simple pawn. Understanding when you’re up or down in a near equal position can help you determine what the best move is. Trading is beneficial when you’re up a minor piece, but up a pawn? That can lead to a small advantage on one side of the board. How can your pieces lean into that advantage and pressure the board that way. On the other hand, going down a piece demands some mature response. You need to understand how to control the speed of the game such that your disadvantage can be minimized. Isolating enemy pieces and finding an aggressive attack in such positions can result in winning positions. If there are enough pieces on the board and your structure is sound enough, then trying to lock into a closed position to time out the opponent is completely viable too. Beginner players are usually trigger happy when it comes to trading. They have difficulty leaving pieces in tension with one another or giving up a piece when trading is not explicitly beneficial. This can lead to very incorrect decisions concerning piece count on the board, especially when they are in losing positions.

Resigning in such lost positions is ill advised. Out of my 2,600 Chess.com games, 110 of those are draws. A draw at the 1600 and above level must be pursued rather than a resignation. 



Fight for the draws!

I made my last 23 moves in the final 10 seconds of the game:

I made around 20 moves in 10 seconds to run my opponents clock down from :33 here:

It is very very difficult to win with lower accuracy. Since beginning this article, I have been on the lookout for games like that. This is one of the only ones I’ve found:

I would be remised if I didn’t mention the best beginner principles that carried me from a beginner player in the 1000 to 1350s range:
1. Take some sturdy claim in the center of the board
2. Develop minor pieces off of their beginning squares
3. Castle to protect the king
