      Chess has been a core hobby of mine since around 2020 when I began to play during covid. It has been a long run 
      of play between the two main websites for online chess lichess.org and chess.com. Between the two I've played probably 
      around 3500 games, which if we assume averages at about 10 minutes total, will come out to 583 hours or 24 days of play 
      time. Fortunately for me, I still feel as though I'm improving after such a large amount of time in game, with my peak 
      being early September 2023. That rating was on Chess.com at 1794, in the top .5% of players internationally, nearly in 
      the top 100,000 players. I'm currently floating around mid to low 1600s, or around the top 1% of players. The difference 
      between 1600 and 1800, while only .5%, is monumental. What happened in September that pushed my rating to its limits?

      I started playing very disciplined and simple chess; frankly, lots of boring moves. Boring chess — what does that even mean? 
      The beginning and intermediate players insist on riveting positions. Cutthroat fights for checkmate, large swings in momentum 
      between players. Queenside castling with a pawn storm to the opponents kingside castle. Unsound gambits like The Meitner Mieses 
      or Evans. Greek Gift Sacrifice comes up a lot in this early player “exciting” chess, as do positions that overload the queen, 
      putting her on the frontline to pressure the board. Naroditsky and Yasser fans immediately jump to the iconic article, 
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/article/view/queen-the-supporting-actress"> Queen: The Supporting Actress</a>.
      {'\n'}{'\n'}

      What does a layman do other than nod? Those positions do look very riveting. The mere forward queen placement is highly 
      intimidating, and - to an untrained eye - front loaded attacking positions appear to benefit the offensive player. High level 
      players may even do this simply as an intimidation factor, and a vast majority of players can get uncomfortable playing defensively. 
      Playing aggressively honestly is a reasonable way to climb the ELO ladder at first; low ELO players can have a difficult time 
      staying calm enough to hold their position and finding the right move, especially in time pressure situations.
      {'\n'}{'\n'}

      These aggressive positions come with a downside though; they neglect straightforward principles of chess that create strong 
      healthy board positions. Instead, tempo is spent on the attack — pieces find themselves out of position trying to construct 
      threats that have basic defenses. The aggression cannot be maintained, and if the defending player can outlast attacks, the 
      resulting positions end up favoring their healthy position. Chess is not a game that can be won within the first few moves. 
      Principles must be observed. Claiming some of the center with pawns, developing minor pieces, and castling — not all advanced 
      play demands these steps, but only experts in chess can understand positions when there is value in neglect.
      {'\n'}{'\n'}

      As I increased my rating slowly but surely, I stopped trying to force exciting initial positions by unsound play, or trying to rush 
      to the end of the game. Around when I was in the 1400s I would play a Giuoco Piano variation I enjoyed that attempted 
      to delay castling until I could castle queenside, hopefully with an open file to attack down on the kingside. In the position, 
      shown below, you can see that Ne2 attempts to bait out a Bxf3 to open the G file. A quick pawn to c3 would fully restrain 
      the C6 Knight. The rooks down the open file show too much strength, and the queen attempting to defend is useless as 
      they bulldoze down the open files. There are a lot of lines in this opening, and I figured the castling neglect was worth the 
      attacking ability.

      Looking through some of the below games is painful, the board is a complete mess in all cases.

      Was this a compelling Giuoco Piano line? No, the reason why this line doesn’t exist in the first place is explicitly 
      because it is dubious, unsound, and impractical. It’s an average player fumbling around on the chess board. In Giuoco 
      Piano positions now I play calm and secure moves. I develop appropriately, and play chess with the long term goal in mind. A 
      quick gimmicky checkmate can be avoided, but a rock solid position will, overtime, overpower the opponent.
      {'\n'}{'\n'}

      Let’s be clear though, playing boring chess was not the only thing I did to increase my rating so significantly. 
      It’s not like I was a Meitner Mieses player before that quit the opening cold turkey. I would occasionally avoid a castle for 
      tempo, but I didn’t refuse it or insist on opposite side castling. Another major part of my improvement over the past year 
      has been playing subtle and quiet moves. Moves that do not heavily impact the position that only improve my board state structurally.
      {'\n'}{'\n'}

      My improvement can also be tied to knowing how to play and when. It’s not uncommon to go down a piece and find yourself in a 
      losing position. At times, such losing positions aren't defined by minor pieces like bishops or knights but can even extend 
      to structural sound-ness, or even a simple pawn. Understanding when you’re up or down in a near equal position can help you 
      determine what the best move is. Trading is beneficial when you’re up a minor piece, but up a pawn? That can lead to a small 
      advantage on one side of the board. How can your pieces lean into that advantage and pressure the board that way. On the 
      other hand, going down a piece demands some mature response. You need to understand how to control the speed of the game such 
      that your disadvantage can be minimized. Isolating enemy pieces and finding an aggressive attack in such positions can result 
      in winning positions. If there are enough pieces on the board and your structure is sound enough, then trying to 
      lock into a closed position to time out the opponent is completely viable too. Beginner players are usually trigger happy 
      when it comes to trading. They have difficulty leaving pieces in tension with one another or giving up a piece when trading is 
      not explicitly beneficial. This can lead to very incorrect decisions concerning piece count on the board, especially 
      when they are in losing positions.
      {'\n'}{'\n'}

      Resigning in such lost positions is ill advised. Out of my 2,600 Chess.com games, 110 of those are draws. A draw at the 
      1600 and above level must be pursued rather than a resignation.

      Fight for the draws!

      I made my last 23 moves in the final 10 seconds of the game:

      It is very very difficult to win with lower accuracy. Since beginning this article, I have been on the lookout for games like that. This is one of the only ones I’ve found:

      I would be remised if I didn’t mention the best beginner principles that carried me from a beginner player in the 1000 to 1350s range:
      {'\n'}{'\n'}
      1. Take some sturdy claim in the center of the board
      {'\n'}{'\n'}
      2. Develop minor pieces off of their beginning squares
      {'\n'}{'\n'}
      3. Castle to protect the king
