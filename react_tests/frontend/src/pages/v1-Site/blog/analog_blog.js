      Vinyl records, film photography, analog synths, vintage books; what's up with this obsession with analog? There was an 
      argument popular years ago for the phenomenon about actual content quality. Specifically popular with vinyl, that the 
      audio fidelity is something that couldn't be rivaled, as well as analog synths, and when it came to film photography, that 
      the colors were unable to be replicated otherwise. Over the past few years though, something even more interesting is 
      happening. CDs, digital cameras, old digital synths, all making comebacks. Whether or not analog fidelity can be matched 
      in the digital world is up for debate (which I tend towards the analog superiority side), but what I think is really at the 
      core of these movements is several factors that can mainly be summed up with one word: Resistance.
