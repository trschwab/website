		Currently I don't have the multiple camera angles to really capture the full set up. Between two desks I have all my gear,
		with the left desk being my two turntables (Audio Technica LP-120) and my mixer (Numark M6). It's all great beginner gear with
		the turntables each having ortofon concord cartidges, much better than the stock cartridge (I believe AT95E). They're still
		important to hang onto though, to bring to a gig. I've seen a video of, maybe Mr G or Moodymann having to switch out a cartridge on the fly
		when one breaks. The left turntable is in channel 1 and the right is in channel 3. This is the standard side of the set up.
		What about channels 2 and 4?
		<br><br>
		This is where we introduce a bit more character.. I include a channel for hardware synths for one. This is channel 4; 
		I only have a TD-3 right now and an RD-9, The TD-3 is synced to the clock on the RD-9 which has simple tempo controls for 
		beat matching on the fly to vinyl channels. I include a VD400 Behringer delay pedal on the TD-3 which helps to add more depth 
		to the sound. I'd be happy with more pedals but for now this is all I have. The power supply on that side of the table is purchased with 
		those future pedals in mind -- the TD-3 and VD400 are both powered by an MXR Iso-Brick. Unfortunately the wattage for the RD-9 is too 
		high to be included. Balancing these sounds can be difficult but I've found a happy middle ground with a Behringer Micromix MX400. 
		I have a Volcabeats that syncs up nicely with everything as well, the time and depth can add a nice sound to the percussion side of things but 
		I keep it unplugged and out of the way because it doesn't add enough. I think next steps for this channel will be the Behringer 808 clone 
		and an SE02 or SH01A. Generally I've found a lot of inspiration in set ups like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQa97koffnA">this one </a> 
		that have a lot of variability despite being tied down to a sequencer.
		<br><br>
		Channel 2 is the only remaining on our mixer but I feel it's very important and probably the most complicated. The idea was partially 
		inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KIvnLBF7vU">this video </a> from Four Tet, specifically the idea of having a live looping 
		component that can allow for really dynamic sampling on the fly. The issue with this is that something like a loop pedal can have a lot of 
		limitations and not really transfer well into the sequencer world, or serve the channel with as much importance as a channel should get. After all 
		there are only 4 and there are no digital decks included, so I really need to make the most of all the inputs. The solution I found included a piece 
		of gear that has been on my wishlist for many years. The famed SP404. I decided to get the MKII which recently came out. This turned out to be an 
		excellent decision as firmware updates still are coming out, recently I even saw updates to the live sequencer which I have yet to explore. This could be 
		perfect for my sound. For now though, the idea of sampling on the fly was at this core as well as leveraging the on board effects unit if I needed. 
		I tried many difference ways to route the live audio through but I always found difficulty with audio quality or with latency issues. The only way that 
		I managed was to route through the headphone monitors.
		<br><br>
		Okay maybe not my brightest idea but it gets the job done. The audio that goes through the monitors to the headphones on my Numark I now 
		split with an aux splitter, and send one to the SP404 input and the other to the normal headphones. This way, I can live listen on the 404 
		by turning on the EXT Monitor. Any audio in the headphones will then go to the 404. It requires a certain touch via the gain so as not to 
		blow your ears out with the headphones or to distort the audio coming from (typically) the vinyl channels but it gets to the 404 in one piece. 
		If you want to record that, you can simple hit record, then chop normally as you would. The best part of the sampling is that you can record a track 
		that is currently being played via the vinyl, or even the next track which is not being played for the audience because it's still just in the monitors. 
		With a little practice you can manage the chop within the limited time, and boom, you have your sample ready for play. Obviously this can also 
		be done ahead of time but is not necessary for planning. The important part I want for this set up is that any of the actions should be able to 
		be done live and on the fly.
		<br><br>
		The other thing that's so great about the 404 and the monitor routing is that the latency is so minimal that you can have EXT Monitor turned 
		on and lower the volume of the origin channel while turning on channel 2. The sound is a bit tin like and thinner, likely having to do with the 
		roundabout routing, via poor cables and finnicky gain staging, but the latency is totally negligible here. I was shocked as how great the latency was. 
		This is to say that you can stop a record and the 404 channel picks up that stop instantly. Suddenly all the FX that you can put on 
		live audio with the 404 are included to the turn tables. I was initially thinking I'd need some sort of clever and dynamic pedal board set up 
		for FX to have them on each channel (I even was a bit thrilled to find the Alesis Bitrman, Philtre, Smashup series that I still have an eye on) 
		but the 404 carries the FX perfectly.
		<br><br>
		Where from here? It's really a great question, I'm constantly torn between many priorities. Any amount of money I could spend 
		instantly on ideas for next steps. The hardware side of things would do great with, as I said before, an RD8, SE02, SH01A, even another TD-3 or 
		something like a Minilogue XD. I'd like to get a keyboard more involved so that I can introduce more live playing. Suddenly questions about my 
		guitar and saxophone are introduced with live playing. They'd likely be in this channel too. Not to mention the FX next steps we could continue down. 
		I think some compression would go a long way here and even trying to isolate the RD-9 kick for a sidechain could be an interesting endeavor.
		<br><br>
		Vinyl is almost constantly being added to my collection so I need to start thinking about more dynamic storage as well as good 
		storage that can also transport the records. The turntables would likely never need to be transported for a gig, but some improved cartridges 
		couldn't hurt. I'd definitely want to get some proper Technics 1200s instead of the ATLP120s which are great but still firmly in the beginner range. 
		I don't feel explicit needs currently for a new mixer, but we will see when that comes up. I imagine it comes up soon as a necessity rather than 
		something being planned. On the other hand, a digital mixing console with many channels doesn't sound bad at all.
