		<h1>Photography - Manhattan Skyline</h1>
		<p>

        <br><br>
        As I begin to settle in with more experience in my film photography, having shot with some inconsistency over the past 3 years, I can take see a sense of style and preference begin to emerge in my photography. Shots that capture me and that I think of as ideas that I’m drawn to. I’ve tried to engage with these shots — and after some time a monotony of style emerges, I’ve pushed through and continued. I’ve found beyond that repetition lay my first collection that I thought of in some sense shooting at the time, but that I also can see in hindsight and agree with in terms that I didn’t or couldn’t have understood at that time.

        This collection began with an interest in the tops of buildings. I liked how there was different styles and embellishments made by the architects and I also liked how they had the sky as a background. The building itself projects itself into the foreground, but yet another detail can emerge: a closer object can exist further in the foreground. Whether another building or a tree, I’ve liked the idea of these stacks within the frame. What could be more simple yet so graceful than this? The more sky is involved, the more calm the photo. The more of the building, the more the subject is presented as an entity. The more the obfuscating tree or feature or other buildings, the busier the shot becomes. Really nothing special. Just a good old fashioned picture of buildings.

        At the time I had initially written notes about the photos I was taking, I had thought of them as some sort of “internal skyline”. The skylines of cities being famous and signifying a sense of belonging. People getting posters or paintings or even tattoos of their skylines. I thought of the skyline as someone living actually inside the city as being very different. My New York City skyline are the corners of buildings that I see everyday, that I know well. The traditional NYC Skyline is something awe inspiring, yes, but I can’t see it. I’d have to be in Jersey or Brooklyn.

        Another thing that makes this collection special is it clearly shows the difference between my cameras as I move from shooting 35mm on a Holga 120 to a Canon FTB.

        <br><br>
        And we end the collection somewhere new -- experimenting with different ISO rolls in teh last few shots, then below with night time photography.
